# Learning Data Structures using C!

I started this repo to take notes on common data structures and implement them using C. Why C, you ask? Well, why not? I've only recently started programming in C and can say it's really fun to learn about the low level stuff. Especially when you're trying to optimize or better understand a higher level problem/implementation.

Each subdirectory will focus on a particular data structure and will also include some random programming exercises along with my solution to those problems.

**NOTE:** if you find a better way of doing something, or just a plain bug please submit a PR â€” I appreciate the feedback and help!

Upcoming or In Progress:

- [] Array ~
- [] Linked Lists ~
- [] Hash Table
- [] Binary Tree
